This Code is Aditya Sharma's application for Professor Porquet-Lupine's lab under the Student Record Analysis project. 

I will forgo details on this project here, and instead provide this google doc link to my report on this project: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q1ohUDoHf7fQb--jkkZRCTDnkxaJnJbMYRIkQ5fnx04/edit

To run this project on your own computer, clone the repository into any folder on your computer, open the folder using Matlab, add all code to the path within Matlab by right clicking on the folder you created in the left window and clicking "add folder and all sub-folders to path". Then run the analyzeStudentRecords.m file with Matlab, Note that as of right now, you will see all the graphs as well as 2 extra graphs (graphs 25, 26) which are left over from a workaround. Also, there seems to be an issue in opening up any of the function files in Level 2 and 3, I am working on fixing that right now, the analyzeStudentRecords.m file should still work as intended, it just seems to be erroring when using matlab to view code in Level 2 and 3.

Keep in mind you can still view the files as text files, although it will not look as nice.
