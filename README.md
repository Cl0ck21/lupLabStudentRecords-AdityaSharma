This Code is Aditya Sharma's application for Professor Porquet-Lupine's lab under the Student Record Analysis project. 

I will forgo details on this project here, and instead provide this google doc link to my report on this project: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q1ohUDoHf7fQb--jkkZRCTDnkxaJnJbMYRIkQ5fnx04/edit

To run this project on your own computer, clone the repository into any folder on your computer, open the folder using Matlab, add all code to the path within Matlab by right clicking on the folder you created in the left window and clicking "add folder and all sub-folders to path". Then run the analyzeStudentRecords.m file with Matlab.

Note that as of right now, you will see all the graphs as well as 2 extra graphs (graphs 25, 26) which are left over from a workaround. 

Also, there seems to be an issue in opening up any of the function files in Level 2 and 3, it seems like if you just click on the files in the project file directory on the left, Matlab throws an error, the workaround for this is to 1. right click on functions-> 2. then click "open function" within any file you are able to open (you should be able to open analyzeStudentRecords.m). Sorry about this, I will try to fix this is I have the time, but this is a low priority for me since it is more of a convenience issue.

Please keep in mind you can still view any of the files as text files outside of Matlab if you prefer, although it will not look as nice.

Thank you for taking the time to check this out!
